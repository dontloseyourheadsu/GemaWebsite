This head uses the common ASCII values, resizable viewport. It links the normalizer.css to work on any browser and then the styles for the whole site. The icon makes reference to the icon shown on the tab in the browser. The html file is in spanish for the translate to be able to work. The title of this web page is shown by the "title" tag. This structure repeats in all my html files except for the "title" tag which varies.
